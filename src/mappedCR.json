This day-end balance also includes any amount that you have in your POTs account.\r\n+\r\nFor example - Let's say that you maintain a day end balance of 15,000 for 10 days in the month, for another 10 days, you have a day end balance of 20,000 and in the remainder 10 days, you have a day end balance of 5000. The MAB is calculated as ((15000*10)+(20000*10)+(5000*10))/30 OR (150000+200000+50000)/30 OR 400000/30 = 13,333.\r\n+\r\nSo, there are 2 ways in which you can track your MAB. You can either manually calculate the day-end balances and then divide that by the calendar days of the month, or you can simply track this directly on the app.",
